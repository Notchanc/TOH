Here are the answers to the SYDS Viva questions:

1. Formulas and Applications of Statistical Tests:

Z-test:




Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}

T-test:


t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}

F-test:


F = \frac{S^2_1}{S^2_2}

Chi-Square Test:


\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test:


D_n = \sup_x |F_n(x) - F(x)|

2. ANOVA and Its Applications:

One-Way ANOVA: Compares means across one independent variable.

Two-Way ANOVA: Analyzes the effect of two factors.

ANCOVA: Includes covariates in ANOVA.

MANOVA: Analyzes multiple dependent variables.

Real-life Application: Used in experimental research, e.g., comparing test scores across different teaching methods.



3. Regression and Its Types:

Linear Regression (y = mx + c)

Multiple Regression

Logistic Regression

Polynomial Regression

Lasso and Ridge Regression



4. Applications of Regression Analysis:

Predicting Sales

Stock Market Analysis

Medical Diagnosis

Weather Forecasting



5. Spatial Series and Auto-Regression:

Spatial Series: Data collected over space (e.g., air pollution levels in different cities).

Spatial Auto-Regression (SAR): Models spatial dependencies in data.



6. Time Series Analysis Applications:

Moving Averages: Used in stock market trend analysis.

Trend Analysis: Used in economic forecasting.
